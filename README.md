## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the development environment and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or another package manager like yarn or pnpm.

### 1. Clone the repository

If you are working with a Git repository, you can clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the required libraries.

### 3. Environment Variables

This project does not currently require any environment variables to run. However, if you add integrations (like an email service API key), you should create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add them there.

```
# .env.local example
SOME_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

## üèÉ Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode with hot-reloading. You can view the site by navigating to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your web browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.
